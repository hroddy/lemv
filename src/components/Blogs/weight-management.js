      <Link href="http://www.dishlab.org/pubs/2013%20Compass.pdf" target="_blank">Weight and weight loss are huge topics in today’s culture.</Link> Some popular
      diets claim calorie restriction, complete elimination of things like
      carbohydrates, or long term fasting are the only ways to reach your ideal
      weight. While some of these methods may work for some people, <Link href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292101/6-potential-dangers-of-dieting/" target="_blank">they aren’t
      necessarily good for everyone.</Link>
    </p>,
    <p>
      Of course, being aware of calorie intake, avoiding foods that cause you
      inflammation, and other elements of diets can be effective depending on
      their use. But each person’s body and lifestyle reacts differently to
      different foods. Rather than trying to find a one size fits all fix that
      often includes extreme diet changes, it is usually easier and more
      effective to implement small but manageable long term changes.
    </p>,
    <p>
      Studies have shown that sticking to a diet that is very different from
      your usual eating habits is difficult and often leads to a yo-yo pattern
      in results. Weight loss may occur during dieting but the extreme changes
      are not sustainable in the long term and when you return to your normal
      eating habits, the weight often returns as well. <Link href="https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(14)00314-6/fulltext" target="_blank">Making small but
      sustainable changes</Link> to your diet may also be difficult at first, but can
      build habits that become part of your daily diet, not completely replace
      it.
    </p>,
    <p>
      Another element of eating for weight loss can be in how you think about
      the process. Oftentimes, thinking about changing your diet in the sense of
      adding in healthier foods rather than trying to avoid less healthy options
      can be easier to maintain long term and can lead to more effective weight
      loss. This works in multiple ways. Constantly thinking about restricting
      food can lead to a scarcity mentality and is an element in many eating
      disorders. Thinking about including more variety of foods into your daily
      eating habits can help avoid these potentially unhelpful mindsets. In
      addition, adding healthy food will naturally displace other food choices
      without requiring avoidance or shame.

    <p>
      Here are some examples of how to change your diet in small but meaningful
      ways by adding foods into your daily diet:
    </p>,
    <ul>
      <li>
        Add a serving of fruit or vegetables to your breakfast. Toast can become
        tomato toast. Mixed berries are easy to add to yogurt and granola.
        Adding a handful of spinach to scrambled eggs can turn a good breakfast
        into a great one.
      </li>
      <li>
        Start with a salad. When eating out, it can sometimes feel like you are
        making choices between what you want to eat and what you should eat.
        Start your meal off with a salad and also get the burger you have been
        craving. If you are adding something to your meal, keep in mind that you
        may not want to finish it all. Don’t be afraid to ask for a box!
      </li>
      <li>
        Make fresh snacks easily available. Sometimes the best part about
        snacking on chips is the fact that they are right there. Switch it up by
        cutting up some fresh fruit or vegetables and setting them at the front
        of your fridge. The next time you are looking for a quick snack, grab a
        handful of blueberries or sliced bell peppers. Other good produce for
        snacks are sliced strawberries, carrots, cucumbers, or celery.
      </li>
    </ul>,

      patience, and self care.</Link> Taking small steps to stay healthy for the long
      term can be a good approach but you should always consult with your doctor
      regarding your health goals.
