      This recipe is perfect for when you are craving a warm bowl of soup that
      makes you feel good inside and out. While carrots are not required, they
      are a great way to add some extra nutrients. You can also substitute the
      carrots for almost any other vegetable you might have leftover, such as
      squashes, eggplant, or mushrooms.
    </p>,
    <h2>How To:</h2>,
    <p>
      Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Cut your tomatoes and onions in half and
      cut the carrots into two to three inch pieces. For the garlic, carefully
      cut off the top of the bulb, leaving the base and papery outer layers
      intact to keep the bulb whole. Check out this video for a more detailed
      description of how to cut the garlic for roasting. In your mixing bowl,
      toss your cut vegetables in the oil, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes
      if you want. If you are not using fresh herbs, you can add them here as
      well.
    </p>,
    <p>
      Arrange the seasoned vegetables on the tray and roast in the oven for 30
      to 45 minutes, until they are dark golden brown and soft enough to be
      pierced with a fork. If you are using fresh herbs, add them to the pan
      five minutes before they are done.
    </p>,
    <p>
      Allow the vegetables to cool slightly before using the blender to puree
      them. Squeeze the garlic cloves out of the papery outer layers, as seen in
      the video above. If you are using fresh herbs, make sure to remove the
      woody stalks from the thyme before blending. If you are using a stand
      blender, you will need to work in batches, pouring the blended soup into
      the large pot as you are working. If you are using a hand blender, place
      the vegetables in your large pot before blending. Add just enough chicken
      stock to create the soup texture you are looking for. If you want a
      thinner soup, you may need more than 1 cup of stock. Water can also be
      used but it will be less flavorful.
    </p>,
    <p>
      Once the soup is your desired texture, you can place the pot on the stove
      to heat and serve immediately, or put in a large container with a lid for
      storage. This soup will last for 3 to 4 days in the fridge or up to 2
      months in the freezer. Labeling your containers with a piece of tape and a
      marker can help you remember when you made it and when it needs to be
      eaten. This soup is wonderful with a grilled cheese sandwich!
