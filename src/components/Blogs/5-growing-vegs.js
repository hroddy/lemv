      Growing your own vegetables can have many great benefits. It is a great
      way to be more connected to your food and food production. Many people
      find{" "}

      . Working in a garden also teaches kids new skills and more about the food
      they eat. While installing and starting a garden can be challenging,
      eventually being able to produce some of your own food can save money. If
      you are looking into getting into growing your own vegetables you have a
      few options.

      Depending on how much space you have you can dedicate a portion of your
      backyard to a garden. Raised planter beds can be found at your local
      garden supply store and installed individually or as a group. Planting
      seasonally can give you almost year-round access to something fresh,
      thanks to the California weather.

      Some vegetables do better in small garden plots than others.{" "}

      as well as kale and swiss chard are known for being able to be harvested
      year round if tended correctly. Radishes, carrots, and other root
      vegetables also tend to do well in backyard gardens. Plants like zucchini
      can be incredibly productive if given enough space but be ready for a
      bountiful harvest!

      If you have less space or don't want to install a large project in the
      yard it is possible to grow some plants indoors. A large window can be
      dedicated to a few pots. Indoor grow lights and set up are also becoming
      easier to find and more affordable. Herbs often are the best choice for
      indoor gardening and can provide some great{" "}

      when added fresh to meals. Small tomato plants can also sometimes do well
      in an indoor environment. The seeds can be germinated then transplanted
      into larger pots once sprouted.

      Gardening can be a complicated process but there are many free resources
      available online to help you get started. Check out the{" "}
      <Link href="https://www.almanac.com/" target="_blank">
        Old Farmer’s Almanac’s website
      </Link>
      . Since 1792, this historical publication has evolved from a pure almanac,
      or annual calendar, to a well known resource for farming knowledge and
      seasonal planting guides.

    <h2>Community Gardens:</h2>,
    <p>
      If starting your own garden is not possible for you due to space or time
      constraints, consider joining a community garden. We are lucky to have a
      few great community garden options here in Livermore. For example,{" "}
      <Link href="https://www.fertilegroundworks.org/" target="_blank">
        Fertile Groundworks
      </Link>{" "}
      is a non-profit garden located off of East Avenue. Founded in 2010, many
      volunteers make this garden possible. Much of their produce is donated to
      people in need. They are also partnered with local food pantries and{" "}
      <Link href="https://www.openheartkitchen.org/" target="_blank">
        Open Heart Kitchen
      </Link>
      . Working in a community garden provides many of the same benefits as a
      personal garden as well as the connection to your neighbors. The
      connections between us are part of what makes Livermore an amazing place
      to live.

      Another option is the{" "}
      <Link href="https://www.larpd.org/community-garden" target="_blank">

      spaces. The Livermore Area Recreation and Parks Department has 70 garden
      plots that can be rented. Keep in mind that these are limited to residents
      within the district boundaries. There is a waitlist, but rentable garden
      space can be a great alternative for those with limited space. Check out
      the LARPD’s website for more information.

      No matter what your garden looks like, getting your hands dirty can be a
      great way to be more engaged with your food and gain a better
      understanding of what it takes to grow vegetables.
