      Eating vegetables is a key step to strong nutrition but there are many
      elements to a healthy diet.

      “Diets” as we think of them in our culture are usually restrictive,
      defined by "no's" and the labeling of some foods as bad. Dieting often
      involves shame and guilt. In this sense, going on a diet is something you
      do temporarily, not because you want to but because you should. While that
      is one definition of diet, it is not the way we use the word.

      Another definition of diet is “the kinds of food that a person, animal, or
      community habitually eats.” According to this definition, our diet is our
      everyday eating habits. For example, my overall eating habits usually
      include pastas, stir frys, salads, lentils, bread, chocolate, and lots
      more. More specifically, I habitually have yogurt or avocado toast for
      breakfast. I also tend to crave something sweet after dinner. These would
      all be considered elements of my diet.

      Some people are very aware of their diet and may have specific limitations
      based on allergies or intolerances. Sometimes our diet is heavily
      influenced by our environments, such as who we live with, where we buy our
      food, or what we can afford.

      If you are looking to change your diet, the first step is to start paying
      attention. Keeping a one week food journal can be a great way to start
      thinking about your overall food habits. Please note that this does not
      mean counting calories, which can be harmful rather than helpful. Once you
      have a good understanding of what you usually eat, you can decide what, if
      anything, you want to change.

      Another good way to start thinking about food differently is UCLA’s free
      Mindful Eating Series. This is “a collaboration between UCLA CAPS and UCLA
      RISE that features pre-recorded content and resources related to food,
      eating, and body image. Resources offered here will provide information
      about how to improve your relationship with food and your body, inclusive
      of opportunities to practice new skills while eating a meal.” This series
      includes videos, podcasts, books, and other resources relating to our
      relationships with food.
