      You’ve probably heard about “inflammation,” but have you ever thought
      about how inflammation affects your gut health? There are trillions of
      microbes, including bacteria, fungi, viruses, and their genes, that live
      inside your gut. Together all these microbes make up your gut microbiome.
    </p>,

      src={inflammation}
    />,
    <p>
      The friendly microbes help you digest foods, make vitamins, and protect
      you from the not-so-friendly microbes. There are more microbes inside your
      gut than all of your human cells. That’s right, you are more than half
      microbe, so let’s see how inflammation impacts this invisible army called
      your gut microbiome.
    </p>,
    <h2>Acute vs. Chronic Inflammation</h2>,
    <p>
      Inflammation is your body’s way of protecting and healing itself. There
      are two types of inflammation: acute and chronic.
    </p>,
    <p>
      Acute inflammation is short-lived. You may recall having a cut, sprain, or
      sore throat. The area feels painful and hot and looks red and swollen.
      These are classic signs of acute inflammation. Inflammation is a natural
      and essential process that your body uses to defend itself from infections
      and heal injured cells and tissues. This is a good thing!
    </p>,
    <p>
      Sometimes it’s possible to have too much of a good thing. When
      inflammation hangs around for weeks, months, or even years, it becomes a
      problem. Chronic inflammation is a slow-burning fire. This type of
      inflammation can exist throughout your whole body at low levels, which
      means that the symptoms aren’t localized to one specific area like a cut,
      sprain, or sore throat. Instead, symptoms can appear gradually and can
      last much longer. This is the “bad” kind of inflammation and it’s linked
      to a variety of diseases, including autoimmune and digestive disorders.
    </p>,
    <h2>What is Gut Inflammation?</h2>,
    <p>
      Gut inflammation and the loss of microbial diversity are often a result of
      our daily habits and environment. One of the worst offenders is eating a
      S.A.D. or standard American diet that is low in fiber and high in sugar
      and chemical additives{" "}
      <Link
        href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31554269/"
        target="_blank"
        cursor="pointer"
      >
        <sup>1</sup>
      </Link>
      . A low-quality diet also hurts your gut microbiome. Other risk factors
      include a sedentary lifestyle, lack of sleep, excess stress, and excess
      alcohol.
    </p>,
    <p>
      Gut inflammation can manifest in a variety of ways. Below I have
      highlighted some of the more common signs of gut inflammation. Some of
      these conditions target the digestive tract directly, while others may not
      even seem connected to digestive health.
    </p>,
    <h2>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)</h2>,
    <p>
      IBD is an umbrella term used to describe chronic inflammation of the
      digestive tract{" "}
      <Link
        href="https://www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/"
        target="_blank"
        cursor="pointer"
      >
        <sup>2</sup>
      </Link>
      . The two most common forms of IBD are Crohn’s disease and ulcerative
      colitis. IBD causes destructive inflammation and can cause permanent
      damage to the intestines. Based on the nature of the disease, IBD is often
      associated with nutrient deficiencies. Analysis of fecal samples from IBD
      patients compared to healthy subjects showed reduced bacterial diversity
      and altered bacterial species abundance{" "}
      <Link
        href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22586430/"
        target="_blank"
        cursor="pointer"
      >
        <sup>3</sup>
      </Link>
      . While there is no agreed-upon diet for treating IBD, a nutrient-dense
      diet that is anti-inflammatory is a good starting point.
    </p>,
    <h2>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)</h2>,
    <p>
      IBS is a common gut condition that is responsible for chronic, relapsing
      symptoms such as abdominal pain, cramping, bloating, gas, constipation,
      and diarrhea. Symptoms can be triggered by stress or foods{" "}
      <Link
        href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25734736/"
        target="_blank"
        cursor="pointer"
      >
      <sup>4</sup>
      </Link>
      . Recent studies have found a link between reduced microbial diversity,
      chronic inflammation in the mucosal lining of the gut, and the development
      of IBS{" "}
      <Link
        href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30288077/"
        target="_blank"
        cursor="pointer"
      >
        <sup>5</sup>
      </Link>
      . A low FODMAP diet can be used to reduce IBS symptoms. A low FODMAP diet
      is an elimination diet and is not intended to be a "forever" diet. FODMAPs
      are a group of fermentable carbohydrates. These fermentable carbs are
      eliminated for 2-6 weeks and then strategically reintroduced to customize
      your own sustainable diet.
    </p>,
    <h2>Food sensitivities</h2>,
    <p>
      Food sensitivities are an adverse food reaction that involves the immune
      system. Reactions occur when circulating white blood cells react to foods
      or chemicals and release proinflammatory mediators into the bloodstream.
      These reactions are often delayed and dose-dependent making them tricky to
      identify. Food sensitivities may also be a sign of leaky gut. When food is
      fully digested it is broken down into amino acids, simple sugars,
      emulsified fats, vitamins, and minerals. These tiny components are then
      allowed to cross the intestinal barrier, which separates your digestive
      system from your bloodstream. When the gut becomes leaky, undigested food
      particles, bacteria, and toxins can enter the bloodstream. These larger,
      unwelcome particles cause your immune system to initiate an inflammatory
      response. Recent research has linked the development of food sensitivities
      to microbial dysbiosis{" "}
      <Link
        href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30214038/"
        target="_blank"
        cursor="pointer"
      >
        <sup>6</sup>
      </Link>
      . Obvious digestive symptoms may or may not be present.
    </p>,
    <h2>Autoimmune diseases</h2>,
    <p>
      Autoimmune diseases involve an abnormal immune response where the immune
      system attacks healthy cells, tissue, and organs. Autoimmune diseases are
      a group of more than 100 chronic conditions. Recent studies suggest that
      gut dysbiosis may be linked to the onset of some autoimmune conditions{" "}
      <Link
        href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32402849/"
        target="_blank"
        cursor="pointer"
      >
        <sup>7</sup>
      </Link>
      . These studies point to a compromised intestinal barrier as the
      underlying cause. Obvious digestive symptoms may or may not be present.
    </p>,
    <h2>Nutrition and Lifestyle Strategies for Reducing Gut Inflammation</h2>,
    <p>
      Did you know that a healthy diet along with positive lifestyle behaviors -
      getting enough sleep, being physically active, managing stress, not
      smoking, and limiting alcohol - are linked to lower levels of inflammation
      and may reduce the damaging effect inflammation has on the body?

    <p>
      Let’s take a deep dive into these simple ways to support a healthy
      microbiome and reduce your risk of gut inflammation.

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>,
    <p>
      Gut inflammation can manifest in a variety of ways. Some of these
      conditions target the digestive tract, while other conditions may not even
      seem connected to digestive health. The first approach to preventing gut
      inflammation is through food and lifestyle changes. Start by focusing on
      adding colorful fruits and vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, and fish
      to your diet. Then layer in lifestyle upgrades like restful sleep,
      physical activity, and stress management.
