      For the lentils, fill a pot with 1 1/4 cups of water or broth for every
      1/2 cup of dry lentils. Add lentils. Bring to a boil, then cover with a
      lid, turn heat to medium and cook until lentils are soft (usually 20
      minutes). There may be extra liquid depending on how firm you like your
      lentils. Drain lentils and set aside to cool.
    </p>,
    <p>
      For the quinoa, fill a pot with 1/2 cup of water or broth for every 1/4
      cup of quinoa. Bring to a boil. Rinse quinoa in cold water while the pot
      heats. Add quinoa while the water is boiling then cover with a lid and
      turn heat to medium. Cook until water is absorbed (usually 20 minutes).
      Fluff with a fork then set aside to cool.
    </p>,
    <p>
      While the lentils and quinoa are cooking, prepare your vegetables.
      Tomatoes, cucumbers, onion, and any other vegetables you are adding should
      be cut into bite sized pieces. The fresh parsley and/or mint should be
      chopped finely. Here is a source on{" "}

      To make the dressing, you can either use a bowl and a fork or a jar with a
      lid. Combine 3 tablespoons of olive oil, 3 tablespoons of lemon juice or
      red wine vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder (or a fresh clove finely
      chopped), 1/2 teaspoon of honey, 1 teaspoon of mustard, and a pinch of
      salt and pepper. Mix with a fork or shake to combine. Taste and adjust
      seasonings, adding more of any ingredients you feel are needed. If the
      dressing is too strong, add more olive oil. If it tastes oily, mix more
      and add more vinegar. Extra dressing can be saved in the fridge for 3 to 4
      days. In general, when I make this dressing, I donâ€™t measure out my
      ingredients. Eyeballing amounts, tasting, and adjusting as needed is often
      the best way to get the dressing the way you want.

      The final step is to combine all the prepared ingredients! In your large
      mixing both, add the cooked and cooled lentils and quinoa as well as the
      cut vegetables and herbs and some of the dressing. Stir to combine and
      taste, adding more dressing until the consistency is right for you. There
      is still time to adjust the flavors too! You may want more of an acidic
      bite (lemon juice or vinegar) or more of a mellow flavor (olive oil).
      Ideally this salad should sit in the fridge for a bit for all the flavors
      to meld together, but you can also serve right away. I usually make this
      recipe right in a large container with a lid for easy storage in my
      fridge. It makes for a great base for a bowl or as a side dish. This salad
      will last up to 4 days in your fridge.

      The great thing about this recipe is that you can adjust the portions of
      any of the ingredients depending on your personal preference. If you would
      rather a more vegetable heavy salad you can double the quantities of your
      preferred vegetables. If you don't enjoy quinoa you can always add more
      lentils or substitute another grain. This recipe can also be a great place
      to use up any leftover vegetables, such as cooked brussel sprouts or raw
      bell peppers.
