    <p>
      You probably already know that nutrition plays a multidimensional role in
      most chronic diseases, so you might wonder if there is a Perfect Diet?
    </p>,

    <p>
      Each person has different nutritional requirements to keep them healthy
      based on their genetics, health, age, activity, lifestyle, etc. Many diets
      will sustain you or keep you alive. But is that really all you're after?
    </p>,
    <p>
      Your Perfect Diet should do more than just keep you alive, it should allow
      you to THRIVE.
    </p>,
    <p>
      {/* <span style="color: tomato">SPOILER ALERT:</span> */}
      <b>SPOILER ALERT:</b> There isn't one Perfect Diet that works for every
      single person on this planet. That would be impossible!
    </p>,
    <p>
      For example, in my household of just four people, we require 3 different
      diets to thrive!
      <ul>
        <li>I avoid gluten for celiac.</li>
        <li>My daughter avoids gluten and dairy to manage her IBD symptoms.</li>
        <li>My husband and son avoid shellfish due to an allergy.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>,

    <p>
      Instead of looking for that Perfect Diet, make sure your diet follows 5
      Principles to ensure its top notch.
    </p>,
    <p>
      These principles are the backbone of the Mediterranean, Vegan, Paleo,
      Flexitarian, Vegetarian, DASH, Whole 30, and even healthy Keto diets.
      These principles can even be applied to elimination diets like the low
      FODMAP diet. In fact, I challenge you to find a healthy diet that doesn’t
      follow these 5 principles, so let's dive in.
    </p>,
    <h2>High in Nutrients</h2>,
    <p>
      Eat nutrients instead of food groups. Nutrients are split into two
      categories: macronutrients and micronutrients.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Macronutrients</b> are the three main substances required in large
          (macro) amounts in the human diet: protein, carbohydrates, and fats.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Micronutrients</b> are vitamins, minerals, and other compounds
          required by the body in small (micro) amounts for normal physiological
          function.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>,
    <p>
      We need a mix of both macronutrients and micronutrients to stay healthy.
    </p>,
    <p>
      While carbohydrates are important, they can be partially synthesized by
      the body. Meanwhile, the building blocks of protein and fat include
      essential amino and fatty acids. When the word essential is in front of
      amino or fatty acids, it indicates that our bodies cannot produce these
      nutrients. We must get essential nutrients from food.
    </p>,
    <p>
      The human body also requires approximately 40 different micronutrients for
      normal metabolic function. Maximizing nutrient density should be the
      primary goal of our diet because deficiencies of any of these essential
      nutrients can contribute to the development of chronic disease and even
      shorten our lifespan.
    </p>,
    <h2>Plant Diversity</h2>,
    <p>
      By eating a variety of plants, you will ensure a variety of nutrients!
      Plants, not animals, are the only source of fiber in our diets. Fiber is
      an important type of carbohydrate – not for only you, but your gut
      microbiome.
    </p>,
    <p>
      Fiber gives us that feeling of fullness, helps with detox, assists with
      digestive motility (poop), and feeds our very important, gut microbiome.
      Humans cannot break down fiber.
    </p>,
    <p>
      The Gut Microbiome contains trillions of microbes. These microbes are
      mostly bacteria, but also include some viruses and yeast. Ideally, the
      microbiome should have a very diverse population of microbes, and most of
      the microbes should be beneficial, with pathogenic (bad) microbes kept to
      a minimum.
    </p>,
    <p>
      The{" "}
      <Link href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29795809/" target="_blank">
        American Gut Project
      </Link>{" "}
      discovered that eating over 30 different plant-based foods per week is
      important for a healthy gut microbiome. The gut microbes feast on fiber,
      which keeps them happy, well-fed, and balanced. A healthy gut microbiome
      is fundamental for a healthy body.
    </p>,
    <p>
      There are two different types of fiber - soluble and insoluble. Most foods
      contain a combination of both, but some have higher amounts of one over
      the other. Both are beneficial for health.
    </p>,
    <p>
      Soluble fiber dissolves in water, acting like a sponge or gel that helps
      escort excess hormones out of the body along with cholesterol. Soluble
      fiber can also help lower blood glucose. Foods high in soluble fiber
      include oats, peeled apples, citrus, beans, and starchy vegetables like
      sweet potatoes.
    </p>,
    <p>
      Insoluble fiber, on the other hand, does not dissolve in water but helps
      move food through the digestive tract. Insoluble fiber is usually found in
      the skins of fruits and vegetables, along with non-starchy vegetables,
      whole grains, nuts, and seeds. Insoluble fiber is the type of fiber that
      helps with regularity.
    </p>,
    <p>
      Most Americans are not consuming enough fiber. The recommended intake
      ranges from 25 to 35 grams per day based on age and gender.
    </p>,
    <h2>Quality Counts</h2>,
    <p>
      Focus on eating real foods in appropriately sized portions.
      <ul>
        <li>
          High-quality foods include unrefined, minimally processed foods such
          as vegetables and fruits, whole grains, healthy fats, and healthy
          sources of protein.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lower-quality foods include highly processed snack foods,
          sugar-sweetened beverages, refined (white) grains, refined sugar,
          fried foods, foods high in saturated and trans fats, and high-glycemic
          foods such as potatoes.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>,
    <h2>Balance Blood Sugar </h2>,
    <p>
      Swings in blood sugar are linked to a variety of symptoms.
      <ul>
        <li>Cravings</li>
        <li>Hunger</li>
        <li>Mood swings</li>
        <li>Fatigue</li>
        <li>Acne</li>
        <li>Hormonal imbalances</li>
        <li>Aging</li>
      </ul>
    </p>,

    <p>
      Here are my top 4 tips for controlling your blood sugar.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Reduce added sugar. The Nutrition Facts label now requires that added
          sugar is listed. The American Heart Association recommends less than
          100 calories/day or 25 grams for women and less than 150 calories/day
          or 36 grams for men.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reduce or eliminate processed carbohydrates. If you’ve already reduced
          added sugar, these are the carbs high in salt and low in fiber.
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid naked carbs! Protect or eat your carbohydrates with protein,
          fat, and/or fiber to slow the absorption and prevent spikes in blood
          sugar.
        </li>
        <li>
          Eat your veggies first! The fiber from the vegetables coats your
          intestines to slow the absorption and prevents a spike in blood sugar.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>,

    <h2>Proper Hydration</h2>,
    <p>
      Humans are approximately 65 percent water. Your body uses and loses water
      through most of its work - detoxification, lubrication, temperature
      regulation, and nutrient absorption. Proper hydration is the key to
      unlocking optimal health, but when it comes to drinking enough water, it’s
      all about absorption.
    </p>,
    <p>
      We’ve all heard of the “8 x 8” rule (to drink eight, eight-ounce glasses
      of water daily), which is traced back to a government recommendation. The
      original guideline recommended that 45 percent of those ounces come from
      food. Over the years, the recommendation morphed into ounces from only
      water. But let’s consider the benefits of hydrating with food, which
      brings us back to plants!
    </p>,
    <p>
      New research indicates that the living form of water in plants may hydrate
      more efficiently. Hydration from plants is already purified, alkaline,
      mineralized, full of nutrients, and readily absorbed by your cells. Eating
      plants with a high-water content can promote deeper hydration.
    </p>,
    <h2>Bottom Line</h2>,
    <p>
      The first approach to preventing chronic disease is through food, but
      there is more than one way to eat a healthy diet. If you are working on
      improving your health, these 5 Principles should be a daily part of your
      diet. If you are already healthy and plan to maintain your health, I
      recommend the 80/20 rule - follow these 5 Principles 80% of the time and
      indulge the other 20%.
