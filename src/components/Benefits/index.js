          Research has consistently shown that adequate vegetable intake
          improves health outcomes and reduces medical expenses by reducing
          medications, decreasing disease states, improving quality of life, and
          displacing less healthy food choices; however, only 10% of American
          adults consume the recommended daily allowance of vegetables.

          As a culture, we have begun to focus more on self care and few things
          impact our health as surely as the food we eat. Eating nourishing food
          is also an act of self-love.
