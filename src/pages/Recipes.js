          Eating a diverse variety of vegetables is most recommended. Luckily in
          California, we have almost year round access to many amazing types of
          vegetables. Frequent guests of the produce sections in town are often
          joined with more seasonal options as well. Trying a couple different
          varieties can often be the best way to find your favorites. Some
          vegetables popular with us are brussel sprouts, zucchini, parsnips,
          kale, cauliflower, cucumbers, and of course garlic and onions! <p />

            The healthiest ways to cook vegetables
          </Link>{" "}
          are methods that preserve most of the nutrients inside the vegetable.
          Therefore, quick cooking methods such as steaming or stir-frying are
          considered the healthiest. While these methods can be delicious, they
          are by no means the only options. Mixing up how you cook vegetables
          will make them more interesting and sometimes easier to prepare! Some
          vegetables are amazing roasted in a hot oven, such as{" "}

          or (surprisingly) broccoli. Slow cookers can help break down heartier
          vegetables into soups or sauces and save time.
          <p />
          Adding more vegetables to what you are already cooking is the simplest
          way to increase your vegetable intake. For example, adding a handful
          of spinach into a casserole your family loves, making that cheese
          omelet into a vegetable cheese omelet, adding a few different
          vegetables to a salad you enjoy making, or working towards a more{" "}
