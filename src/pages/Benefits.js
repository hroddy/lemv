          The short answer is: yes. <p />
          Research has consistently shown that adequate vegetable intake
          improves health outcomes and decreases disease states. It also reduces
          medical expenses by reducing medications and displaces less healthy
          food choices. Overall, eating vegetables improves your quality of
          life. <p />
          The truth is most people do not eat enough vegetables. In a study done
          in the United States in 2019,{" "}

            only 10% of adults were eating enough vegetables.
          </Link>
          <p />A staggering 90% of American adults are not eating enough
          vegetables and the health impacts of a lack of vegetables are often
          undiscussed. A survey done by LEMV in Livermore in 2022 revealed that
          most Livermore residents interviewed were not eating enough
          vegetables. <p />
          One of the goals of LEMV is to improve education and awareness of the
          importance of vegetables as part of a healthy diet. While most people
          know that eating vegetables is good for you, this general knowledge is
          strongly supported by well-documented and peer-reviewed studies and
          reports. The true extent of the impact that diet in general and
          vegetable consumption specifically has on our health is immense. While
          more studies are still underway, here is some information on what we
          know about the importance of eating more vegetables.

          <p />
          The results of this study were released in a statement written by a
          panel of 15 experts from multiple disciplines who agreed that diet can
          achieve remission without surgery or other active pharmacologic
          therapies. The experts agreed that “diet as a primary intervention was
          considered most effective when emphasizing whole, plant-based foods
          including whole grains, vegetable, legumes, fruits, nuts and seeds.”
          More studies were called for by the panel to include research into
          “sustainable plant based dietary interventions.” This data is great
          news to the many people with chronic illness who may have been told
          they can only be treated through invasive or expensive methods.

          Exhausting medical bills can be cut down or avoided altogether when a
          healthy diet helps us maintain our physical and mental health.

          Adding vegetables to your meals often involves replacing other
          elements of your diet with vegetable alternatives. Choosing a salad
          instead of fries while eating out is a common example of vegetables
          taking the place of other food options. Even if your chosen vegetables
          are served as well as other things, they will keep you fuller for
          longer and help avoid snacking later. <p />
          Thinking about changing your diet in the sense of adding in healthier
          foods rather than trying to avoid less healthy options can be easier
          to maintain long term. This works in multiple ways. Constantly
          thinking about restricting food can lead to a scarcity mentality and
          is an element in many eating disorders. Thinking about including more
          variety of foods into your daily eating habits can help avoid these
          potentially unhelpful mindsets. In addition, adding healthy food will
          naturally displace other food choices without requiring avoidance or
          shame.

          Our health impacts all areas of our lives. When we are busy, we often
          look for cheap and filling meals and these types of meals can often

          Whether you are seeking to improve your health, prevent disease, or
          simply take better care of yourself, eating more vegetables is a great
          place to start. There are no simple answers to complicated questions
          about health; if you have any questions or concerns, consult your
          doctor and ask specific questions regarding your nutrition needs.
